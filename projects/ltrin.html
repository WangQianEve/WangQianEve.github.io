    <div>To learn about the problem space, we first reviewed our existing integrations and learned this is our first integration that user will be configuring automation on the Lutron App. Then we started using Ring products ourselves to build empathy with users. We learned the motion detection can be overly sensitive sometimes. We also did competitive research and found people are already hacking the integration using a 3rd-party platform -- IFTTT. The IFTTT hacks gave us lots of insights on what capabilities users may want.</div>
