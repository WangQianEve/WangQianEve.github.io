            <b>1. Build empathy by using Ring products </b><br/>
            We used Ring doorbell and cameras ourselves to build empathy. A key insight gained from this activity is
            that, motion detection can get overly sensitive under certain situations like a windy weather.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>2. Online research </b><br/>
            We found online that people are already hacking Lutron and Ring together with IFTTT. The most popular
            function is to activate a Lutron scene with Ring doorbell.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>3. Hypothetical persona and user journey</b><br/>
            We gathered persona information from existing research. Then we developed a user journey based on
            assumptions, which were captured as things to validation in the user research, along with other questions
            and unknowns.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>4. Develop setup concepts</b><br/>
            Guided by the lean approach, and to get some validation from real users, we developed 2 concepts for the
            setup experience (task analysis, information architecture design, and wireframing). We chose setup not only
            because it's the most fundamental function, but also because Lutron App has more precedence to reference for
            different kinds of setup.
