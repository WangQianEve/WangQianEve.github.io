                <b>1. Build empathy by using Ring products </b>(pic1)<br/>
                We used Ring doorbell and cameras ourselves to build empathy. A key insight gained from this activity is that, motion detection can get overly sensitive under certain situations like a windy weather.

We chose setup not only because it's the most fundamental function, but also because Lutron App has more precedence to reference for different kinds of setup.
